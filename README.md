Analyzation on NBA matches using movement data

Possible bachelor thesis

Here there is only the example data. More can be found on [this repository](https://github.com/smeznar/nba-movement-data), which is a fork from [sealneaward's repository](https://github.com/sealneaward/nba-movement-data).

For now animations work, but will be optimized in the future probably.
